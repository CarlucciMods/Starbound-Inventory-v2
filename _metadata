  "description" : "3 years ago I developed a mod for myself because I liked organization and deep pockets, so after making it I decided to share it with everyone.\n\nUp until it was removed, it was 5 star mod and had over 1 million downloads, thanks to everyone for that. Please pass this around and let every know its back for good. Ill be working on this mod at the end of the month. I know there are simple bugs, but still very playable and stable. Please report to the team on my discord.\n\nI now have a discord as a central hub, any questions or issues must be done at https://discord.gg/E7KFxKE.\n\nmake sure you install on new game, otherwise It will mess up your file. There is a work around, see Bk3's Inventory Mod Discussion for details.\n\nAll updates, bugs, fixes, reports, artwork and ideas for the mod can only be found at my discord.",
