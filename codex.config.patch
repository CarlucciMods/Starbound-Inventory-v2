/*
Why does this file exist?
Because certain unnamed mods have borked their patches
resulting in codexes being without a category.

No category means it won't filter into the correct tab
and it was requested that I fix it.  And so I have.
But I only fixed the categories as the rest isn't important
nor relevant to this mod.
